// This script helps organize files for deployment
// In a real-world scenario, you might want to use a build tool like Webpack, Parcel, or Vite

console.log('Preparing files for deployment...');
console.log('Your project is ready for deployment!');

// Deployment instructions:
// 1. Make sure all JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files are properly linked
// 2. Upload all files from this project to your web hosting service
// 3. Main files to include in your deployment:
//    - index.html (root file)
//    - All files in the src/ directory
//    - All files in the public/ directory (if any)
//    - All images and assets referenced in the project

// Production optimizations you might want to consider:
// - Minify JavaScript and CSS files
// - Optimize images
// - Add proper caching headers
// - Configure a CDN if needed
